Ben has nice friends and we usually let him go out whenever he ask , but the other night, Ben stayed out until 11pm without our permission. We stopped him from going out for a fortnight. Now he ofen shout at us and neglects his homework . My husband and I had strict parents so we try to be strict but fair with our own children . 
When Ben was 7, my younger brother died . It affected Ben deeply because they were very close , just like friends . 
Nicholas isn ' t as bad as Ben but his bedroom is always mess and we often argue with him about it. 
He never makes his own bed and expects me to do it for him. So we decided to punish him. No TV for a wole week . But it didn ' t work. He was good only for a fortnight after that. 
Tiffany isn ' t too bad but she often quarel with her brothers . She also copies their bad habits. She refuses to wear her school uniform and sometimes uses bade language.
